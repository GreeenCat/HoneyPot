# HoneyPot
A honeypot is an important security tool that can help detect and mitigate unauthorized access attempts on a network. This code provides an implementation of a simple honeypot in C++. The program begins by prompting the user to enter a port number that they would like to use for the honeypot. The code then creates the honeypot on the specified port. If the port number entered is less than 1023, the program checks if the user is running it with root privileges. This check is necessary because port numbers below 1023 are reserved for known services and typically require elevated privileges to listen on.

With this honeypot, network administrators and security professionals can better understand the potential security threats to their network and take the necessary measures to protect their systems. By setting up a honeypot, you can monitor incoming connections and track any suspicious or malicious activity. This information can be used to improve the overall security of your network and prevent unauthorized access attempts in the future.
